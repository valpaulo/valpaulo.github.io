							<p>In this guided Power BI/Excel case study, I investigated a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyzed their churn rates.</p>
							<p>Objective: <br>The objective of this project is to analyze Databel's customer churn data and formulate an actionable strategy to reduce churn rate by addressing underlying issues.</p>

									<p>INVESTIGATIONS</p>

									<p>The churn rate for Databel hovers around 27%, with competitor-related factors accounting for 45% of customer churn.
									Analysis of the churn rate by age reveals that senior citizens experience a churn rate 10% higher than the average of 38.22%. 
									Furthermore, when categorizing customers by age groups, there is a consistent upward trend in churn rate across the age brackets.								</p>

									<p>Regarding contract types, Databel provides group contracts to households, offering customers discounted rates and serving as a means to expand its customer base. 
										Analysis indicates that contracts consisting of six customers exhibit the lowest churn rate at 23%. 
										Additionally, customers with monthly-based contracts exhibit higher churn rates compared to those with yearly contracts.

									<p>Analyzing data plan usage, Databel initially hypothesized that customers not on an unlimited data plan were more prone to churn. 
										However, the analysis suggests that customers with unlimited plans are actually more likely to churn. 
										Further investigation based on average monthly GB downloads reveals that the highest churn rate occurs among customers on unlimited plans who consume less than 5GB of data per month.

									<p>In analyzing international calls activity, Databel requested an investigation into its correlation with churn. 
										They are interested in understanding the behavior of customers who engage in international calling and whether subscribing to an international plan affects their loyalty. 
										Notably, California (CA) exhibits a high churn rate, with 72% of customers in this state making international calls without having an international plan.</p>

									<p>Databel seeks to enhance its customer service following reported issues. 
										Analysis reveals a correlation between frequent customer service calls and above-average churn rates. 
										Additionally, examination of payment methods indicates that customers on monthly contracts who utilize direct debit make an average of 1.47 service calls per customer. This group experiences a churn rate of approximately 54%.

									  <p>Here are two business plan suggestions based on our findings for Databel:</p>
									  
									  <div class="business-plans">
										
										  <strong>International Plan Optimization:</strong>
										  <ul>
											<li>Identify customers subscribed to an international plan who haven't utilized international calling.</li>
											<li>Propose a downgrade to a more suitable and cost-effective plan, explaining the rationale behind the recommendation.</li>
											<li>By offering a cheaper plan aligned with their usage patterns, we aim to enhance customer satisfaction and prevent churn.</li>
											<li>Target the 72% of customers in California without an international plan as potential candidates for this new promotion.</li>
										  </ul>
										
									  
											<strong>Payment Method Investigation:</strong>
										  <ul>
											<li>Given the observed churn rate among customers with direct debit payment, investigate potential issues related to this payment method.</li>
											<li>Analyze payment records and customer feedback to identify any discrepancies or challenges faced by customers.</li>
											<li>Address any payment-related concerns promptly to ensure seamless billing processes and enhance customer retention.</li>
										  </ul>
										
									  </div>
									  
									  <p>Implementing these strategies could help Databel optimize its offerings, improve customer experience, and reduce churn rates.</p>
